India internationally for over 24 years.[11] In 2002, halfway through his career, Wisden ranked him the
second-greatest Test batsman of all time, behind Don Bradman, and the second-greatest ODI batsman of all
time, behind Viv Richards.[12] The same year, Tendulkar was a part of the team that was one of the
joint-winners of the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy. Later in his career, Tendulkar was part of the Indian
team that won the 2011 Cricket World Cup, his first win in six World Cup appearances for India.[13] He
had previously been named "Player of the Tournament" at the 2003 World Cup.</pre></div>
